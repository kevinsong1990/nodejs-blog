# This is my blog project
I will develop this project as my new personal blog site. I will spend almost 2 months to complete it.

# Angular JS + Express JS + Mongo DB
Angular JS is an execent Javascript framwork in UI frontend. Express JS is an popular Node.js module in UI backend. 
And it's popular to use them together now. 

So I will use Angular JS in frontend, and Express JS as UI server in backend.

The database I want to choose Mangodb, because I really want to learn it in the same time.
